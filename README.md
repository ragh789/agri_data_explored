# agri_data_explored
The AgriData Explorer project is focused on analyzing and visualizing Indian agricultural data to gain insights into crop production, yield, and cultivation patterns. Initially, I performed data cleaning and preprocessing in a VS code to ensure the dataset was accurate and ready for analysis. After cleaning, I carried out Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends, patterns, and anomalies across different crops and states. I created visualizations in Python for various EDA questions to identify key insights over time.Next, I split the workflow into two Python scripts for better modularity. In the first script, I wrote a program to upload the cleaned CSV data into a local PostgreSQL database (pgAdmin). This allowed structured storage and easy querying. In the second script, I wrote SQL queries to answer important agricultural questions. Using these SQL queries, I connected Power BI to the CSV data and ran the queries to generate visual outputs.I completed 10 SQL questions and created 10 corresponding visualizations in Power BI to clearly represent insights from the data. Each visualization helps stakeholders understand production trends, crop yields, and state-wise cultivation comparisons. Overall, the project demonstrates the integration of Python, SQL, and Power BI for data-driven agricultural analysis. It provides a comprehensive dashboard and analytical solution for exploring Indian agriculture effectively.
